I love the film V for Vendetta and now, I have this academic curiosity...

"Voil√†! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition.

[carves V into wall]

The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.

[giggles]

Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it is my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V."

- V for Vedetta (2005 Film)


Seriously, what greatly interests me about the V Programming Language is this:

The comparison of V with other great compilers, along with each space and time required to build each compiler:
(Space, Build time)
Go (525 MB, 1m 33s),
Rust	(30 GB, 45m),
GCC (8 GB, 50m),
Clang	(90 GB, 60m see: https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2019-April/132028.html)
Swift	(70 GB,	90m see: https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/1f9da381dcdef98df2a7313d8729750cbac54f45/README. md#getting-started), and 
V	(< 20 MB, <1s see https://github.com/vlang/vc/blob/master/v.c)
