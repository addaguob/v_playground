/* Hi, I am Alexander Daguob, and am embarking on a new exploration of the V Language in Software Engineeing.

What intrigued me?

The comparison of V with other great compilers, along with each space and time required to build each compiler:
Space  	Build       time
Go	    525 MB	    1m 33s
Rust	30 GB	    45m
GCC	    8 GB	    50m
Clang	90 GB [0]	60m     (see: https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2019-April/132028.html)
Swift	70 GB [1]	90m     (see: https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/1f9da381dcdef98df2a7313d8729750cbac54f45
                                /README. md#getting-started)
V	< 20 MB [2]	    <1s     (see https://github.com/vlang/vc/blob/master/v.c)


So...
CAN I REALLY DEVELOP A MAINTAINABLE SOFTWARE WITH V's SIMPLICITY?
Let's learn and find out! :)
